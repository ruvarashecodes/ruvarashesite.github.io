        <h1>This is how my 2024 went</h1>
        <p>15 November 2024</p>
        <h4>Python</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h4>First Year</h4>
        <p>So I started my first year in Computer Science this year. I initiaklly did not even want to do Computer Science if I am going to be honest, I wanted something to do with Math so my main goal was to transfer to that in second year.<br>
             Turns out Computer Science is just another glorified Math degree so I actually started to enjoy so much I forgot to apply for a transfer. Rating all my modules, I give MAT105 a 10/10 I absolutely enjoyed Calculus but Linear Algebra <br>
             was a bit challenging (which I actually loved), well Stats was not as challenging, I was kinda bored so I give is a 6/10 and for COS101 (Introduction to Computer Science), I enjoyed Java more than Python but the overall course content was interesting so I give that an 8/10 <br>
             To be honest I did not find first year to be as difficult as I thought it would be, it was a breeze and I currently have a GPA of 89.5% but that's for two modules and will probably drop cause of my one Math Paper lol.

        <h4>Moving To Capetown</h4>
        <p>I moved to Capetown for uni. Was it planned? No, but it has been an experience. I struggled to adjust to the weather at first because summer gets really hot so I had constant headaches and why is the sun on full blast at like 7 a.m? I had constant jumpscares thinking I was late for school <br> 
        cause of the light and heat but it will literally be 7 a.m. Winter was not any better. I did not know it rained in winter till I was already here and I am not a winter person let alone a wet winter? However, it really is a beautiful city and I would not mind staying here inspite of the ridiculous cost of living. </p>
