        <h1>This is the stuff I plan on doing in 2024</h1>
        <p>December 2024</p>

        <h2>Tech Goals for 2025</h2>
        <p>Next year, I want to push myself, but I am keeping it realist. I'm not trying to become the next big tech genius—just better than I was yesterday. So here's what I'm aiming for: </p>
    

        <h4>Learn the basics of Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>Machine learning sounds intimidating, but I want to start small. I'll focus on simple concepts like regression and classification and use tools like Scikit-learn. Nothing crazy—just enough <br>
             to get a feel for it and maybe build something cool</p>
   
        <h4>Explore AI Tools</h4>
        <p>Instead of diving deep into building AI models, I'll play around with pre-built tools like Hugging Face or AI APIs. It's more about understanding how they work and seeing what's possible rather <br>
             than reinventing the wheel.</p>
        
        <h4>Get Better at Core Programming</h4>
        <p>I'm already decent at Python and Java, but I know there's room to grow. I'll spend some time on coding challenges (maybe LeetCode or HackerRank) and focus on solving problems better and faster.</p>
        
        <h4>Try a New Web Tech</h4>
        <p>I've been doing HTML and CSS, but I think it's time to explore something new. Maybe Flask or React—something that'll make my websites feel more dynamic.</p>>
    
        <h4>Build a Couple of Projects</h4>
        <p>My goal is to work on one or two small but meaningful projects. Maybe a portfolio site or a data visualization tool—something practical that I can look back on and feel proud of.</p>

        <h2>Personal Goals for 2025</h2>
        <p>While I'm excited about the tech goals, I also want to focus on improving myself so here is what I am aiming to achieve in 2025</p>
        
        <h4>Continue Graphic Design</h4>
        <p>I've made some solid progress with graphic design, and I want to keep that momentum going. This year, I'll experiment with new tools like Figma or maybe dive deeper into Illustrator. It's still a <br>
            hobby for me, but one that I really enjoy and want to get better at.</p>

        <h4>Seek Adrenaline-Fueled Adventures</h4>
        <p>I am honestly not the most daring person I know and this is going to be way out of my comfort zone but you're only 21 one right?I've always thought it'd be fun to try something wild, so this year I'm <br>
             adding some thrill to my life. Maybe bungee jumping, zip-lining, or even rock climbing—something that makes me step out of my comfort zone (and maybe scares me a little).</p>

        <h4>Travel and Explore</h4>
        <p>I want to get out more and see new places. Whether it's a quick trip to somewhere nearby or something bigger, I just want to experience more of what's out there.</p>
    
        <h4>Improve Work-Life Balance</h4>
        <p>Balancing everything was tough at the beginning of my degree. I had to sacrifice my personal life to keep that 80+ GPA, and while it paid off, it also taught me the importance of balance. This year, <br> 
            I'm trying to change things. I want to make time for hobbies, relaxation, and just living life a little more. Productivity is important, but staying sane while I'm at it is even more important.</p>
